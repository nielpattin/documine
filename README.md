Minimal self-hosted collaborative markdown editor with inline comment threads. Built for humans and agents.

## Architecture

- React + Vite frontend in `apps/web`
- Hono API server in `src/server.ts`
- WebSocket collaboration over `/ws`
- `.md` files on disk with collaborative state stored in note sidecars

## Quick Start

Run the full local stack:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` for the frontend and `http://localhost:3120` for the API.

## Features

- Collaborative real-time editing (multiple tabs, multiple users)
- Remote cursors with names
- Inline comment threads anchored to text selections
- Threaded replies, resolve/reopen
- Share notes with configurable access (view, comment, edit)
- CLI for humans and agents (owner API keys or share links)
- Owner and shared CLI workflows for humans and agents
- Dark and light theme
- Mobile support
- `.md` files on disk (derived from collaborative state)

## API Server

```bash
pnpm install -g documine
documine serve                    # port 3120, data in ./data
documine serve --port=8080        # custom port
documine serve --data=/var/documine  # custom data dir
```

This starts the backend API only.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The API runs on `http://localhost:3120`. The frontend runs on `http://localhost:5175`.

The API is backend-only. It serves JSON and WebSocket endpoints, not the React app.

## Global CLI

For local development of this repo:

```bash
pnpm link --global
```

For a global install from a published package:

```bash
pnpm add -g documine
```

## Docker

```bash
cd docker
bash control.sh startdev
```

This starts the API on `http://localhost:3120` and the frontend on `http://localhost:5173`.

## Sharing

Click the share icon in the editor to configure access:

- **Not shared** (default)
- **View only**: read-only preview
- **View & comment**: preview with comment threads
- **Edit & comment**: full collaborative editor with comments

Each note has a stable share URL (`/s/<id>`). Anyone with the link gets the configured level of access, both in the browser and via the CLI. Toggle access without changing the link.

## CLI

The CLI works in two modes depending on how you register.

### Owner mode

The instance owner creates API keys from the settings gear on the landing page. An API key grants full access to all notes.

```bash
documine register myserver https://documine.example.com <api-key>
documine myserver list
documine myserver search "query"
documine myserver read <note-id>
documine myserver create "My note"
documine myserver edit <note-id> '[{"oldText":"foo","newText":"bar"}]'
documine myserver comment <note-id> "quoted text" "comment body"
documine myserver reply <note-id> <thread-id> <message-id> "reply"
documine myserver resolve <note-id> <thread-id>
documine myserver reopen <note-id> <thread-id>
documine myserver edit-comment <note-id> <message-id> "new body"
documine myserver delete-comment <note-id> <message-id>
documine myserver delete-thread <note-id> <thread-id>
documine myserver update <note-id> title "New title"
documine myserver delete <note-id>
```

### Shared mode

Anyone with a share link can use it to register. No API key needed. The link itself is the credential, and access depends on what the owner configured (view, comment, or edit). This works for both humans and their agents. Humans can use the link in the browser for better UX.

```bash
documine register shared https://documine.example.com/s/abc123
documine shared read
documine shared edit '[{"oldText":"foo","newText":"bar"}]'
documine shared comment "quoted text" "comment body" --name="My Agent"
documine shared reply <thread-id> <message-id> "reply" --name="My Agent"
```

### Agent integration

Register the instance with an owner API key or register a shared note URL directly. Agents can then read, edit, and comment through the CLI and HTTP API.

## Data

```
data/
  auth.json
  notes/
    <id>.md
    <id>.json
```

The `.md` files are derived from the collaborative editing state stored in the `.json` sidecar. The JSON is the source of truth. The markdown files are written for convenience (grep, backup, external tooling).

## HTTP API

All owner endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <api-key>`.
